12 records written to where.js
Open where.html to view the data in a browser

The file (where.html) consists of HTML and JavaScript to visualize
a Google Map.  It reads the most recent data in where.js to get
the data to be visualized.  Here is the format of the where.js file:

myData = [
[42.3396998,-71.08975, 'Northeastern University, 360 Huntington Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA'],
[40.6963857,-89.6160811, 'Bradley University, 1501 West Bradley Avenue, Peoria, IL 61625, USA'],
[32.7775,35.0216667, 'Technion, Viazman 87, Kesalsaba, 32000, Israel'],
   ...
];

This is a JavaScript list of lists.  The syntax for JavaScript
list constants is very similar to Python so the syntax should
be familiar to you.

Simply open where.html in a browser to see the locations.  You
can hover over each map pin to find the location that the
geocoding API returned for the user-entered input.  If you
cannot see any data when you open the where.html file, you might
want to check the JavaScript or developer console for your browser.
